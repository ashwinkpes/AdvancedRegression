## General Information
- The project aims to perfrom the following,
- Read and understand the data
- Perfrom Exploratory data analysis
- Perfrom feature engineering
- Conclude on the best possible varibales to be used for SalesPrice detection

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Final observations are as below,
- We prefer to use Lasso as it gave higher R2 score
- We prefer lasso as it also perfromed feature selectio
- Finally, the most imortant varibales found are "GrLivArea", "OverallQual', 'YearBuilt', 'TotalBsmtSF'
